Presenteract
====================

Easily create simple HTML/CSS/JS slideshows, which are interactive.

Audience members can follow along on their cell phones, tablets, and computers,
and can vote on polls, answer questions, provide feedback, and simply be able
to read what's on the screen.


Usage - as Presenter
--------------------

To present, you must login, via Facebook or via Google.  Once logged in, you'll have an option for "My Presentations" and the ability to add new ones.

New Deck/Presenations will be created without any slides.  You must add at least one slide to be able to use it.

Only "Open" Presenations are available to audience members.  You can edit Presenations while open, and audience members should get your changes automatically synced.

Only the "owner" / "creator" of a Presenation can control/run it.


Usage - as Guest
--------------------

Connect to the currently "open" deck, for this presentaiton.  Often there is a QR code or a URL provided to make this simpler.

Wait for the Presenter to change slides for you.

Polls should be very simple, just choose an option and submit.

Enjoy the ride...  the presenter is in charge of navigation.
